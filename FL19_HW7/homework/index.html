        <p class="text">Game has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who
        has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to
        one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
        If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
        The winner is the one who won 3 times
